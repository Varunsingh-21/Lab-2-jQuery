            <p>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>
            <p>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Saving the world with meals on wheels. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.</p>
